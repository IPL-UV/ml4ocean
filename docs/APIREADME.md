## Installation

1. Make sure that [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is installed.
2. Clone the git repository


```bash
git clone https://github.com/IPL-UV/ml4ocean.git
```

3. Create a new environment from the `.yml` file and activate.
   
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate 2019_ml_ocean
```

1. (Optional) If you already have the sample `.yml` file then to save time whenever I upgrade it, just run these commands.

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml
```
